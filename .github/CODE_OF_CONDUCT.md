# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our
community a positive experience for everyone. We are committed to providing a
friendly, safe, and welcoming environment for all, regardless of background or
identity.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment:

- Being respectful and considerate of differing viewpoints
- Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
- Focusing on what is best for the community
- Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior:

- Trolling, personal attacks, or deliberately inflammatory comments
- Publishing others' private information without explicit permission
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of
acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when
an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces.

## Enforcement

Instances of unacceptable behavior may be reported to the project maintainers
via [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/jchilcher/ledgr/issues). All complaints
will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.
